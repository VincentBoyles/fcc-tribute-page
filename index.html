                <li><b>1892</b> - Born in Taal, Batangas</li>

                <li><b>1921</b> - Earned an undergraduate and master's degrees in Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Science.</li>

                <li><b>1922</b> - Returned to the Philippines to focus on addressing the problem of malnutrition in her homeland.
                        She got jobs with the Food Preservation Division of the Philippine Bureau of Science and at the 
                        Centro Escolar University.</li>

                <li><b>1925</b> - She displayed a range of canned and preserved local foods, including a whole canned mango. Among 
                        her almost 700 innovations and recipes are Soyalac (a drink made from soya beans); flour made from 
                        cassava, green bananas, and coconuts; darak (a rice flour high in Vitamin B-1); a recipe for fish balls 
                        that tasted like corned beef; and banana ketchup.</li>

                <li><b>1926</b> - Traveled through China, Japan, and Hawaii visiting over 50 canneries. When she returned, she was made 
                        chief of the Food Preservation Division and then of the Home Economics Division.</li>
                        
                <li><b>1934</b> - Was head of the Plant Utilization Division of the Philippine Government's Bureau of Plant Industry.</li>

                <li><b>1941</b> - When the Japanese attack began on the Philippines just a few short hours after Pearl Harbor, Maria's 
                        family evacuated to their homes in Batangas Province. Despite their pleas, Maria stayed in Manila to feed 
                        those who could not leave. “My place is here,” she said, “I cannot in conscience abandon my work and my girls.” 
                        The last time Maria's niece Helen saw her, Maria gave her a pack of cigarettes and told her to be hopeful. 
                        On the package were the words “I shall return,” the promise of General Douglas MacArthur to the Philippine 
                        people when American forces withdrew under the Japanese onslaught.</li>

                <li><b>1942</b> - She followed in her father's footsteps, and became part of the resistance. In her lab, she and 400 of her 
                        students prepared nutrient-dense rations. This kept these women working and fed while they were trapped in 
                        Manila by the war. Maria and her team also provided others with food - including smuggling it to prisoners 
                        in the Santo Tomas Internment Camp. Located on the campus of the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, the 
                        camp held over 4,000 prisoners, most of whom were American. Her decades of work to create local foods instead 
                        of reliance on imports went a long way to helping Filipinos survive the war.</li>

                <li><b>1945</b> - Battle of Manila began, with MacArthur and the American forces fighting to retake the city from the Japanese. 
                        Maria Orosa was working in her lab (as usual) when a round of artillery shelling began. On the way to a bomb 
                        shelter with her staff, Maria was hit by shrapnel. Despite the danger from the ongoing attack, one of Maria's 
                        colleagues found a pushcart and took Maria to Remedios Hospital. The hospital was originally organized by the 
                        Philippine Red Cross in the Malate Catholic School, but it quickly ran out of funds and was being run by volunteers. 
                        Shortly after her arrival, on February 13, 1945, she and over 400 others were killed when an American bomb landed on 
                        the hospital. Burial for Maria and the others had to wait, as the Japanese were shooting anyone in the streets. 
                        She and the others were buried in a mass grave several days later.</li>

                <li><b>2020</b> - Archaeologists from the University of the Philippines were excavating a tomb behind what had been Remedios Hospital. 
                        Built in the 1950s, it contained the remains of 12 volunteers who kept Remedios Hospital running and who were killed 
                        when the hospital was bombed. During the excavations, archaeologists were surprised to find a stone engraved, 
                        “MARIA Y. OROSA / NOV. 29 1892 - FEB. 13 1945 / DIED IN LINE OF DUTY.” Excavation showed that the stone is a memorial 
                        and does not mark Maria's final resting place. Archaeologists think they know which mass grave her remains may be in, 
                        but the mystery remains unsolved.</li>
